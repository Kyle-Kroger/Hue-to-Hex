## How to Play

Hue to Hex is an interactive web-based color game that leverages the power of web technologies to engage and challenge users with a test of their color identification skills. Built using React and TypeScript, this game presents players with a visual representation of a color based on its hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) values. Players are then tasked with entering the correct hexadecimal (hex) color code that matches the displayed color.

Each time you guess you will be given, visually, the color you just guessed and a wordle like repreentation of the characters in the HEX code guessed.

- Grey background characters are not in the secret hex
- Yellow background characters are within the hex but not in the correct location
- Green characters are in the correct location within the hex

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React

The game employs a combination of DOM manipulation and CSS styles using React to dynamically render colors and provide real-time feedback to the player. A random HSL value is generated for each round, and the corresponding color is displayed within a user-friendly interface. A text input field allows players to enter their best guess for the hex color code, and upon submission, the game checks the accuracy of the response.

### Something I learned

## Optimizations

- Add in animations for when the color is guessed
- Add in difficulty levels and time limits

## Lessons Learned:

This project was a really great way for me to better understand on how typescript works.
